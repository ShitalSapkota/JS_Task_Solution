// Create a Magic 8-Ball program that emulates the classic fortune-telling toy. The user will input a yes-or-no question, and the program will output a random response from the 8-Ball. Implement the program using conditional statements to select and display one of several predefined responses.

let user_name = prompt("What is your name?");  // prompt pops up the window and display the question.
